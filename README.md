## Changes

The most significant change I made to current dashboard was making good use of space to greatly improving cite aesthetics and usability.

1. Main section clearly shows the two column layout.
2. Removed headings to maximize space while still maintaining component function.
3. Displayed collaborators using inline style with a dot separator.
4. Resized scrollbars.
5. Made repetition stat more coherent
6. Ensured dashboard is responsive on all screen sizes.
